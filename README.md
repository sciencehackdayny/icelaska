[project] team "mean girls" prototyping solutions for alaskan hunters


## TEAM MEMBERS

* Vishnu Ravi
* Jaya Kasa

## PROBLEM 

The sea ice apps challenge which is part of NASA's Space Apps Challenge post inspired this group to create an app to help hunters in Alaska hunt on the ice, giving them satellite and safety trajectory information available through APIS. 

## PURPOSE

This app should allow the hunters to navigate without having to remove their gloves, using shake and micro gestures to avoid exposing skin for dexterity in extreme climate conditions. It also caches information so if they lose internet connection, they still have access to their data.
